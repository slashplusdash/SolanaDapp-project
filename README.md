# SolanaDapp-project

For rust files, I used solana playground (https://beta.solpg.io/)
I used quicknode for connection with the blockchain and used solana playground for my backend (https://beta.solpg.io/)
I imported my solana playground's program id and IDL to my constant folder's index.js and todo.json
